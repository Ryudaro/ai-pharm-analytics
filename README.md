# AI-Pharm Analytics

AI-Pharm Analytics is an early-stage project focused on demand forecasting
and analytical modeling for pharmaceutical and pharmacy sales data.

The project aims to develop a local-first forecasting system tailored
to real-world pharmacy environments, where data privacy, model
interpretability, and reproducibility are critical requirements.

## Scope

- Pharmaceutical and pharmacy demand forecasting
- Time series analysis and statistical modeling
- Machine learning approaches for demand prediction
- Local deployment without mandatory cloud infrastructure

## Current status

The project is in an early development stage.

At this phase, the repository focuses on:
- problem formulation
- methodological groundwork
- system and architecture design

Implementation details, datasets, and production code
are intentionally not published at this stage.

## Planned directions

- Classical time series models (SARIMA and related approaches)
- Machine learning models (e.g., gradient boosting)
- Evaluation on real-world pharmacy sales data
- Reproducible and transparent forecasting pipelines

## Notes

This repository represents an ongoing research and engineering effort.
The structure and contents will evolve as development progresses.
